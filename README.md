# -Student-Information-Management-System-

A C#-based Student Information System that integrates a relational database (SQL Server) for managing student records, courses, and academic performance. The project leverages a C# front-end with data access via ADO.NET, providing user-friendly CRUD operations, robust validation, and secure authentication. The SQL Server backend uses a fully normalized schema with stored procedures and views for efficient data handling. The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment.
